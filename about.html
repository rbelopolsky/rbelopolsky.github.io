        <h3>Who is me?</h3>
        <p><large><i>A brief description</i></large></p>
        <br>
        <p class="caps">Professional</p>
        <p>I'm a creative, a problem solver and a storyteller. I often create something from nothing and work with cross-functional teams to mold that something into what is needed. I visualize and design in my head as soon as a spec or idea has been given to me. I'm never satisfied with my work, never convinced anything is perfect, always willing to test and refine. As soon as my initiatives in a particular sprint are done, I jump to my own list of 30 other things I want to work on before the next sprint. I listen to others when they speak, not because I'm quiet or unsure of myself, but because I'm trying to get to the root of what they're saying and understand. I believe a designer's responsibility is to shine a light in the fog and make certain the outlines of the vague. I've been doing this a long time and I can be vocal if my experience tells me that a mistake is being made. My work is not my life, but I do enjoy the meaning I get from it, take professional growth seriously and I'm proud of my accomplishments thus far.</p>

        <p class="caps">Personal</p>
        <p>I'm happiest when the present can be described using the Danish term: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-year-of-hygge-the-danish-obsession-with-getting-cozy" target="_blank"><u>Hygge</u></a>. I'm a caring and laid-back person. I'm social but I also enjoy my quiet time. I love to banter with friends on topics tame and wild. I love a philosophical debate. I spend time improving the space and the things around me. I am constantly looking for well-designed furniture and often try to breathe new life into beat up antiques. I sketch plans and build things (most recently an outdoor ping pong table and a small deck). I paint and play guitar occasionally, but it seems my work in these art forms is not as widely appreciated as my other work. Speaking of my wife, I love our little family and have even learned to appreciate our very talkative and troublesome cat, Oliver. </p>

        <h3>To the aspiring UX designer</h3>

        <p class="caps">Preface</p>
        <p>In my personal life, I try not to give advice unless asked- and even then I try to be careful about the advice I give. That being said, there is a whole industry built around unqualified people giving bad advice and charging money for it. But, if it weren't for my mentor giving me the advice she gave me years ago, I would probably have had a much more boring life. Her advice was simple: <i>Go into tech, you can find a place for yourself that works for you, you'll learn, grow and you'll find the kind of security you need to explore your other passions. All without having to work a job that forces you to sacrifice who you are.</i> My advice is her advice plus my rant below, I give it only in the hope of a tiny chance that it helps.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The skill that any good designer must have is: Taste. Taste doesn't make you a good designer, but it gives you the superpower of recognizing and differentiating between good and bad design. It's also a double-edged sword, since this same superpower forces the designer to see and accept just how bad their designs are. There is only one remedy: practice, or the general act of doing. You have to do, steal, copy, deconstruct, reconstruct, iterate, tweak, grow and somewhere along that path, you have to learn to listen and accept criticism. On top of all this doing, you have to accept the designer's lot. That is, designing in many ways is a subjective practice and experience. There are near universal principles like ratios and space, but even these can come and go with the breeze of fashion. For the most part, <i>good design</i> is simply the consensus of the majority at any moment in time. There are those that truly invent or reinvent, but even those individuals require either station or sponsorship and acceptance by others to eventually reach the summit of consensus. You have to accept that- in order to navigate the inevitable moment in every designer's life, when you present a design that you poured your time and passion into, and a stakeholder (that may have many skills but may lack either taste or the vocabulary to effectively express their input) takes that design and tells you something along the lines of "I feel like it needs more...  pop", or "I just don't think it works", or requests so many changes that the original is unrecognizable, or they simply throw it in the trash. So that's the bad news. Here's the good news: sometimes that stakeholder is right- and if you take it in stride, accept it (after throwing a chair out of the window) and learn from the experience, it will make you a better professional. Sometimes the stakeholder is wrong- and with time you'll learn to effectively communicate your design decisions and fight for them, which will make you a better stakeholder and resource. Sometimes, both you and the stakeholder are simply fighting for your subjective views- and you'll go and run a split test and find an objective answer, not in terms of who is right, but which design <i>works for your users</i>, which will make you a better user experience designer. User experience design is still a fairly new philosophy, it's a bargain that designers make: our egos in exchange for the objective truth that the data tells, which frees us from the shackles of opinion (including our own). User experience designers lay the foundations of how humanity will interact with a digital world that grows exponentially more important every day. An interaction pattern or flow or element you create can solve a problem not just for your product- but for many, it can become precedent and bring joy or lessen the burden of infinite users, infinite people. We are, at worst, people that care about others and are trying to make their digital lives easier and their experiences enjoyable. At best, we're pioneers laying the tracks to a happier digital world.</p>
