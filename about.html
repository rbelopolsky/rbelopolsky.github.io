        <p class="caps">Professional</p>
        <p>I'm a creative, a problem solver and a storyteller. I can create something from nothing, I can take the lead and run with an idea alone or I can be a team player and collaborate throughout the design process. I'm never satisfied with my work, never convinced anything is perfect, always willing to test and refine. I listen to others when they speak. I've been doing this a long time and I can be vocal if my experience tells me that a mistake is being made. My work is not my life, but on the best days I do genuinely love it.</p>

        <p class="caps">Personal</p>
        <p>I got married to my best friend last summer:</p>

        <p>I sketch plans and build things like this small deck and wooden furniture:</p>

        <p>I paint occasionally (but it seems my work in this art form is not widely appreciated):</p>

        <p>I really love album covers, so I make playlists on spotify and spend far too much energy on the covers:</p>

        <p>Like a lot of designers and creatives, I get lots of requests to design things for friends and family- like my friend's recent fantasy romance novels:</p>

        <p>A few other things about me:</p>

          <li>I'm a native New Yorker (still here!)</li>
          <li>I prefer Dunkin' to Starbucks</li>

        <h3>To the aspiring UX designer</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="caps">Preface</p>
        <p>In my personal life, I try not to give advice unless asked- and even then I try to be careful about the advice I give. That being said, there is a whole industry built around unqualified people giving bad advice and charging money for it. But, if it weren't for my mentor giving me the advice she gave me years ago, I would probably have had a much more boring life. Her advice was simple: <i>Go into tech, you can find a place for yourself that works for you, you'll learn, grow and you'll find the kind of security you need to explore your other passions. All without having to work a job that forces you to sacrifice who you are.</i> My advice is her advice plus my rant below, I give it only in the hope of a tiny chance that it helps.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The skill that any good designer must have is: Taste. Taste doesn't make you a good designer, but it gives you the superpower of recognizing and differentiating between good and bad design. It's also a double-edged sword, since this same superpower forces the designer to see and accept just how bad their designs are. There is only one remedy: practice, or the general act of doing. You have to do, steal, copy, deconstruct, reconstruct, iterate, tweak, grow and somewhere along that path, you have to learn to listen and accept criticism. On top of all this doing, you have to accept the designer's lot. That is, designing in many ways is a subjective practice and experience. There are near universal principles like ratios and space, but even these can come and go with the breeze of fashion. For the most part, <i>good design</i> is simply the consensus of the majority at any moment in time. There are those that truly invent or reinvent, but even those individuals require either station or sponsorship and acceptance by others to eventually reach the summit of consensus. You have to accept that- in order to navigate the inevitable moment in every designer's life, when you present a design that you poured your time and passion into, and a stakeholder (that may have many skills but may lack either taste or the vocabulary to effectively express their input) takes that design and tells you something along the lines of "I feel like it needs more...  pop", or "I just don't think it works", or requests so many changes that the original is unrecognizable, or they simply throw it in the trash. So that's the bad news. Here's the good news: sometimes that stakeholder is right- and if you take it in stride, accept it (after throwing a chair out of the window) and learn from the experience, it will make you a better professional. Sometimes the stakeholder is wrong- and with time you'll learn to effectively communicate your design decisions and fight for them, which will make you a better stakeholder and resource. Sometimes, both you and the stakeholder are simply fighting for your subjective views- and you'll go and run a split test and find an objective answer, not in terms of who is right, but which design <i>works for your users</i>, which will make you a better user experience designer. User experience design is still a fairly new philosophy, it's a bargain that designers make: our egos in exchange for the objective truth that the data tells, which frees us from the shackles of opinion (including our own). User experience designers lay the foundations of how humanity will interact with a digital world that grows exponentially more important every day. An interaction pattern or flow or element you create can solve a problem not just for your product- but for many, it can become precedent and bring joy or lessen the burden of infinite users, infinite people. We are, at worst, people that care about others and are trying to make their digital lives easier and their experiences enjoyable. At best, we're pioneers laying the tracks to a happier digital world.</p> -->
