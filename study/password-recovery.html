                  <h3>I. Goals</h3>
                  <p>My main goal was to improve user experience with a flow that allowed users to recover their passwords quickly and efficiently, free from extraneous visual noise that would distract or confuse them. Accomplishing this would reduce attrition rate and result in an increase in return user rate. This also presented an opportunity to match this flow with our most up to date brand aesthetic. Finally, I wanted to improve our returning users'experience while leaving navigational options for “lost” new users in an elegant way.

                  <h3>II. Research</h3>
                  <p>I captialized on readily-available data to make assumptions on basic improvements. Initially, I focused my research on topics related to UX patterns that improved recovery flow, before embarking on some on the ground research, testing the flows of websites that displayed awareness and concern for their users.</p>
                  <p>I wanted to create a new UX icon set specific to this flow to illustrate function and purpose. Visual cues can quickly summarize requisite actions and signal to the user that they are still within the correct flow.</p>
                  <p>The old password recovery flow served links to registration and promotional pages that were distracting. My data also showed clicks to pages whose behavior flows ended with a high exit rate.</p>
